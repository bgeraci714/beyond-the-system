You send a droid to fetch it for you. It's small enough that using your ship's equipment to fetch it would be difficult. The droid brings it on board and your ship's computer analyzes the material. It's springy and plant-like. Your ship determines that it is indeed alive, capable of living in the harsh environment of space, and feeds off of the small amount of light gathered from the nearby star. You figure that you can convert it into something edible. It doesn't taste greatbut at least it's something to eat.
