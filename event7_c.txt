You send a droid to fetch it for you. It's small enough that using your ship's equipment to fetch it would be futile. The droid brings it on board and your ship's computer analyzes the debris as it sits in the observation room. $During the analysis process, the purple growth splits open and tentacles unfurl from its core and began pulsating. Startled, you move away from the creature and lock it in the observation room. It regains its strength and in an amazing feat of strength, it rips through the ship and flings itself into open space. The damage is considerable  and the room can't be used until repairs are done.
