You're floating along in space and you find yourself very bored. You look out the window and see a strange glimmer off in the distance. It could be dangerous but it looks more interesting than anything else. You find something even better than you were expecting. A chunk of what looks like a satellite floating in space. You move your ship up slowly, trying to get a better look at an inscription on the side. It reads "ISS".
