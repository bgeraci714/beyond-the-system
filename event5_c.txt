You manage to spend some fuel landing on the planet. Its air looks oddly thick and gaseous. It is clear that the planet is uninhabitable. You spend a good chunk of your oxygen leaving your ship and exploring its surface but you manage to find some raw materials that can be used to strengthen and repair your hull.
Send a droid to scout the planet for you.

You command one of your droids to explore the planet and look for useful materials. It takes several days but the droid reemerges with materials that can be used to strengthen and repair the hull. The droid, however, is damaged and you are not sure at this point if it should be fixed or scrapped.
