You come across a planet that looks inhabitable. You land and discover it is inhabited by many strange beings. They attempt to communicate with you but you have no idea what they are saying. They appear equally confused. You attempt to ask about the transmission but are met with blank stares. One of the strange beings becomes loud, aggressive, and hostile. You flee to your ship and leave as quickly as you can. Your journey was futile and you leave feeling more confused and defeated than ever before.
