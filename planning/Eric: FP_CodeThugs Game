Game Progression:
Construct Ship: Point buy system
	Structure 
		Engines & Computers
			Used for more efficient fuel consumption & Map scouting
	Storage
		Carry more Biomass and Fuel and Oxygen, better for longer journey
	Crew
		Used to run engines and computers. Consumes resources, crew = health?
Exploration
	Map
	Location Discovery
		Possible Locations
			Waystation
			Depot
			Unexplored Planet
Resource Management 
	Oxygen 
		Oxygen Depletes over time, No conversion.
	Crew/Biomass
		Convert biomass into medicine, food, and fuel
		Convert Crew into biomass
	Fuel
		Use fuel/Biomass to convert into oxygen
Event Management.
	Every blank tile there’s an event chance. 
		Events can be good or bad or neutral
		Possible events
			Cult Created/Progression on ship
			Alien Derelict Discovered
			Asteroid field
Win/Lose conditions 
	Find planet
	Run out of resources and die
	Alternate Event ending. (EG, cult summons a demon, everyone’s converted to robots, ship mutinies .)

Possible Structure of Program
Main
	Construct ship 
(Pass back stats on crew, storage, and ship parts(scouting range and efficiency))
	Begin exploration 
		Explore map, see X number of tiles around you, where X is scouting.
	Movement
		Takes up X levels of biomass, fuel, oxygen to move Y amounts of spaces
		Check map tile for event (Planet, satellite, depot, ect)
	Resource Management 
		View Levels of Resources
		Convert resource X to Y
	Event
		Determine if event is going to happen.
			If not, make event more likely for next turn
			If so, determine which event.
				Good event = Gain resource/structure/crew
				Bad event = lose resource/structure/crew
Story event = Begin story, if this story happens more than once (eg, multiple cult events, progress cult growth.)
	Check if out of a resource
		If so, lose game
		If no, Check win condition.
			If win condition has not been achieved, Return to exploration.
