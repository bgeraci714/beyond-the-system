You can't live here anymore. Your home planet has recently sustained a massive natural disaster caused by a large asteroid. Many members of your species have succumbed to its affects. Luckily, you managed to bunker down in your ship and leave with everything intact. $You believe, quite rightly, that you may be the sole survivor of your species and head out on a journey fueled by a well-known transmission received and broadcasted by your species' officials several weeks before the incident. You have saved it to a small data storage device roughly the size of your thumb and have uploaded it to your ship's onboard computer. 

The transmission displays as follows:

     I look up from Earth and try to see
     The planets looking back at me.
     I gaze at bright and distant stars
     And search for Mercury, Venus, Mars.

     I squint at the Milky Way way up high
     And look for Jupiter in the sky.
     Where are Saturn, Uranus, Neptune?
     They're far away, high like the moon. 

     A telescope would be the best
     For spotting Pluto and the rest.
     I look for planets in the sky
     I look Beyond the System. 

Attached is metadata that you have analyzed revealing coordinates that you believe is the origin of the transmission. You embark on a journey to find where it came from.
