You reach what you beleive to be the location of the transmission. However, you're surrounded by nothing but empty space. You realize that either you have the wrong location or the beings who sent it are long gone. There is nothing for you and no hope. You could soldier on and continue to survive but you wonder to what end.
You come across a planet that looks inhabitable. You land and discover it is inhabited by many strange beings. They attempt to communicate with you but you have no idea what they are saying. They appear equally confused. You attempt to ask about the transmission but are met with blank stares. One of the strange beings becomes loud, aggressive, and hostile. You flee to your ship and leave as quickly as you can. Your journey was futile and you leave feeling more confused and defeated than ever before.
You find a planet that seems inhabitable and decide to land. You discover it is inhabited by beings similar to yourself. They approach you and your ship cautiously. When it becomes clear that you are not hostile, the ends of their mouths curl upwards in a smile. They lift their hands and move them side-to-side saying, "Greetings." You recognize this as a friendly gesture from an ancient language that you are only somewhat familiar with. Regardless, you are able to communicate basic concepts and ask about the transmission. A few of them join you on your ship and review the transmission data with you. "Ah yes," they proclaim. "We sent this many years ago and thought that no one would ever find it." You are not entirely sure what this means but you think that they will accept you as a new inhabitant of the planet and seem sympathetic and intrigued by how you reached them. You live out the last of your days peacefully on the planet, your new home.
