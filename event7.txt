You find yourself floating through a rather uninteresting part of space. You haven't seen anything of interest today. There's a large, bright star in the distance and you can tell that you are close enough to it to start feeling its warmth. A piece of space debris comes into view. It appears to have an unusual, bulbous purple growth.
