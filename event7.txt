Things have been calm for a few days. You are floating through a rather uninteresting part of space. Several big planets have passed on the way but you haven't seen anything of interest today. There's a large, bright star in the distance and you can tell that you are close enough to it to start feeling its warmth. A piece of space debris comes into view. It appears to have an unusual, purple growth.
