You open the container and pour some water next to the creature. It leans down and seemingly absorbs the liquid through its skin. Suddenly, the creature becomes lively and runs around the area. The other plants around began shaking and more emerge. You happily pour more water on the ground and the creatures seem all too pleased to accept it. $They look up at you before casually walking deeper into the foliage, beckoning you to follow. Soon they bring you to a group of bushes and trees with fruit. You stock up and grab as much as you can fit in your pack. The planet's rich atmosphere allows for your ship to collect a considerable amount of oxygen.
Save your water. You don't want to waste it.

You stare dumbfounded at the creature for a minute before briskly walking back to your ship. Killing them for food just seems wrong and you shudder to think what else could be living on such a strange planet. The rich atmosphere allows for your ship to collect a considerable amount of oxygen.
