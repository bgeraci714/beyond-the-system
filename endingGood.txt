You find a planet that seems habitable and decide to land. You discover it is inhabited by beings similar to yourself. They approach you and your ship cautiously. When it becomes clear that you are not hostile, the ends of their mouths curl upwards in a smile. They lift their hands and move them side-to-side saying, "Greetings." You recognize this as a friendly gesture from a language that you came across along your journey. You are able to communicate basic concepts and ask about the transmission that you received when your adventure began. A few of them join you on your ship and review the transmission data with you. "Ah yes," they proclaim. "We sent this many years ago and thought that no one would ever find it." You are not entirely sure what this means but you think that they will accept you as a new inhabitant of the planet and seem sympathetic and intrigued by how you reached them. You live out the last of your days peacefully on the planet, your new home.
