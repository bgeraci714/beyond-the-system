While traveling through a large solar system with two big stars, you come across a green, luscious planet. You figure that it must have food or fuel for you to scavenge and so you land your ship. Upon exploration, you come across plants that appear edible. $As you are digging one out of the ground, you notice it is attached to a small creature where the plant's roots would be. Its body resembles a root vegetable and it looks up at your water container with big, round eyes.
