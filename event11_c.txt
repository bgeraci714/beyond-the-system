You command the computer to turn off its signal detector. The situation is too risky. You feel discouraged from ever turning it on again.
Attempt to figure out who it is coming from and what they might be trying to tell you.

You command the computer to save the transmission's audio data. You play it over and over again, listening closely for any hint or clue as to its inception. You become feverish and obsessive with solving the mystery of what it all means. $You believe you may have an idea of how to locate where the transmission came from and began furiously adjusting the computer's power usage and processing capabilities. The computer saps power from the ship and it burns through a bit more fuel in the process. $Over the course of a couple hours, the computer determines the direction of the signal and takes a guess at its origin. You compare it to the onboard map of the extent of known universe to you and find it coming very far from any planets or even solar systems, the middle of no where. You command the computer to return to default power settings and slump back in your chair. You feel defeated.
