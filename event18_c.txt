You find something even better than you were expecting. A chunk of what looks like a satellite floatinging in space. You move your ship up slowly, trying to get a better look at an inscription on the side. It reads "ISS". You take a closer look at the object and see what appears to be some sort of hint: "Milky Way". You're not really sure what this means but you do remember hearing about strange creamy looking galaxies when you were younger. Maybe it's a clue. 
Turn back, it's probably dangerous.

You safely get away, missing what could have been a valuable chance to get another clue as to where you're going.
