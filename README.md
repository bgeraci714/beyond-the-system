To get the game to run, all you need to do is run game.py and the rest is taken care of. 


Beyond the System is a procedurally generated space exploration game meant to serve as the final project for our programming fundamentals class created by Blake Geraci and Ashley Hartzler.

The game can be broken down into several key components. 

1. The introductory phase.

  1a. Introducing the setting, what the point of the game is, etc. 
  
2. The space exploration phase

  2a. Procedural generation of sections of space with different events per square per map

  2b. Semi-randomized events to provide diversity of gameplay with 20+ events to encounter. 
        
  2c. Survival aspects that place greater emphasis on choices in events.
  
3. The ending of the game.

  3a. You made it to Earth. 
  
  3b. You got lost and died in space. 
  
  3c. You landed on the earth but didn't get the key information you needed for a happy ending.
