It's been days since you've seen anything even remotely interesting. It's been nothing but empty space. Your ship's computer has a program that searches for radio signals and up until this point, you haven't bothered using it. Why would you? No one you could even speak to is alive anyways. At least, you highly doubt it. $Regardless, you turn it on today for some reason that you do not fully understand. After several hours, it picks up on something. You hazily command the ship's computer to play the transmission, expecting it to be the equivalent of white noise. Instead, your ears are graced with garbled sounds similar to speach that cut in and out. Could something or someone be creating this message hoping to communicate?
